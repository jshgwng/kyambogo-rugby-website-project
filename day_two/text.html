    <p>Nothing on earth is creepier than snakes. People dislike how snakes slither frightfully into the under growth. We dislike their yoked tongue and glistening scaled skin. We hate how they raise their heads off the ground like an evil vine. But that is just us, the regular people.</p> </div>
<div class="paragraph-wrapper ">
<p>James Ntulume, is not regular. He is a herpetologist. He loves snakes to the moon and back. He has loved them from as far back as when he was six years old. He found two snakes in the compound at their Muyenga home, picked them up and put them in a bottle. He took them to his bedroom and kept them there. Whenever he woke up, he picked them up, took them outside, fed them and put them back under the bed.</p> </div>
<div class="paragraph-wrapper nmgp">
<p>After a few days, his mother found the snakes while cleaning the bedroom and asked whose they were. Six-year-old Ntulume proudly said they belonged to him. Why would he keep snakes under his bed? his mother wondered. The young son simply replied that he loved snakes. Still shaking from the scare, his mother told him to concentrate on school and then he could go and chase his snake passion. She was hoping that the passion would fade in-<br/>to nothingness as Ntulume grew older.</p> </div>
<div class="paragraph-wrapper nmgp">
<p>But Ntulume’s passion for snakes never died. Some people are born singers, others are gifted sportsmen, Ntulume was born a snake prodigy.</p> </div>
<div class="paragraph-wrapper nmgp">
<p>Today, the 55-year-old is a herpetologist. He has been for the past seven years. For decades, he had inadvertently run<br/>away from his passion. When he finished his undergraduate degree in IT at Makerere University in the 1990s, he found a job in the corporate world. Promotions came, money flowed in, but he could not stop thinking about his first love. And so, whenever he chanced upon some extra cash, he found himself buying tools that he would need to catch snakes and study them. Whenever he got some free time away from his IT work, he would go out to look for snakes. Whenever he visited a new country, the first place he visited was the snake sanctuary. And whenever he heard of a workshop or a training about<br/>snakes anywhere on earth, he paid and attended. Because the heart wants what the heart wants.</p> </div>

<p><strong>Snakes Uganda</strong><br/>In 2017, after 30 years of corporate grinding, Ntulume was in top management at one hospital chain in Kampala, but the fat cheques did not stop him from quitting the life of big desks and strongly worded emails. His real calling was working with snakes and that is what he had always wanted to do. The allure of corporate life had pulled him away from his passion long enough, but a red line had to be drawn.</p> </div>
<div class="paragraph-wrapper nmgp">
<p>He decided he would henceforth fully concentrate on rescuing snakes,bridging the gap between them and humans and spending time making their lives better.</p> </div>
<div class="paragraph-wrapper nmgp">
<p>He already had all the tools of the trade so all he needed was to register a company and lean in. That is how Snakes Uganda Ltd was born.</p> </div>
<div class="paragraph-wrapper nmgp">
<p>“The purpose of my work is to eradicate the human-snake conflict. I created my company to sensitise humans<br/>about the true nature of snakes so that we could all live peaceably with them. Most of the calls I receive are due to<br/>snake sightings in communities. I train people to get rid of their fear of snakes,” Ntulume says.</p> </div>
<div class="paragraph-wrapper nmgp">
<p>Irrational ophidiophobia is what Ntulume deals with every day. The callers are always screaming with fear after sighting a snake. It is Ntulume’s job to calm them down because panic is the main cause of snake bites. Because to snakes, loud noises are akin to attacking them physically. And so, most of what he does is sensitise people about snakes and helping people fight their fear.</p> </div>
