                    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping the way students learn, with tools like ChatGPT and
                        Grammarly becoming common study aids. While some professors embrace AI for research and
                        tutoring, others worry about academic integrity.</p>

                    <p> “I use AI to generate study guides and clarify concepts,” says Jake Morales, a sophomore in
                        Computer Science. “It helps me understand difficult topics faster.”</p>

                    <p>However, universities are implementing stricter plagiarism policies and AI-detection tools to
                        ensure originality in assignments. The debate continues, but one thing is certain—AI is here to
                        stay.</p>
